LiquidTWI High Performance i2c LCD driver
by Matt Falcon (FalconFour) / http://falconfour.com
modified by Stephanie Maks / http://planetstephanie.net
Adapted and optimized from LiquidCrystal bundled with Arduino

Version 1.2

Changelog:
* 1.2 / January 2012
  Modified by Stephanie Maks to re-introduce legacy support along with
  support for the new Arduino 1.0 IDE.
* 1.1.s / December 2011:
  Modified by Stephanie Maks to drop legacy support and work with the
  Arduino 1.0 IDE. Also includes the bugfix for the startup/init problem.
* 1.1 / 6-17-2011:
  Oops... initial bugchecking was done on one program (performance test).
  LCD_DISPLAYCONTROL functions were sending bit 7 (backlight) to the LCD as
  part of the command, invalidating most commands and setting the cursor to
  address 0 instead of doing their function. That also screwed up the
  initialization routine something fierce. A miracle this slipped by testing.
* 1.0 / 6-12-2011:
  Initial release

Distributed with as free-will a license as is available given this code's long
associative chain of licenses (LiquidCrystal -> Arduino -> Wiring -> ...?). Use
it in any way you feel fit, profit or free, provided it fits in the licenses of
its associated works.

Usage:
Attach CLK pin to ANALOG 5 pin (remember: analog pins double as digital!),
Attach DAT pin to ANALOG 4 pin,
Give it 5V using    5V     pin,
Then,  GND it with  GND    pin, and you're all set!

LiquidTWI lcd(0);
void setup() { lcd.begin(16,2); }
void loop() { lcd.print("Happy!"); delay(500); lcd.clear(); delay(500); }

If you changed the i2c address of the board (multiple LCDs? I dig it!), set
"lcd(0)" to your new 3-bit address.
If you have more than a 16x2 LCD, change "lcd.begin(16,2)" to reflect the
columns and rows of your LCD.
